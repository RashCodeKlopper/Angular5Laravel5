Commit code to local Git repository

open CMD in your project folder

Initialise git :
git init

Tell Git who you are:
git config --global user.email "rashcodeklopper@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "RashCodeKlopper"

Determine your file’s status. Remember that git status allows us to see 
the status of the files on our branch at any given time. 
Your file is listed under the heading Untracked files:
git status

Add your file to the staging area so it’s prepared to become part of the next commit:
git add <FILE-NAME>

Commit your file. A commit tells Git to collect all of the files 
in the staging area and store them to version control as a single unit of work. 
git commit -m "your message"
